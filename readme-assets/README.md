# ReadMe-Assets

This is the *readme-assets* directory, where you place files that are shown in the README, such as:
screenshots, logos, gifs, etc. You can reference them inside your `README.md` file by their relative path (e.g. `./readme-assets/logos/blue_logo.svg`)

Such files are placed inside of this directory in order to not pollute the top level directory with readme-related content, as such media is irrelevant to the project itself.

It is divided in three folders:
- **logos**: Official logos of the app
- **images**: Screenshots and other app-related images
- **gifs**: Application gifs

This is an opinionated structure. You are free to add / remove folders as you see fit.
