**Read-My-README** is a simple tidy README template loosely based on the [*Best-README-Template*](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template).

It is originally tailored to be used by Mobile Projects, but it can be easily customized to fit other different use cases.

Still Feeling Uninspired? Here are some samples that use this README-Style with certain customizations:
* [*Xpensor*: A Local Android Expense Tracker](https://github.com/jxareas/xpensor)
* [*LaunchPad*: An App about Space Events](https://github.com/Tonnie-Dev/LaunchPad)
* [*Goalie*: A Qatar 2022 App](https://github.com/jxareas/Goalie)
